Black Jack Game / 21 Card Game

By Anton Clayton

Description:
- This project is my first finished Javascript project. While the project lacks good visuals and could be improved, it demonstrates the basics of Javascript. 
- The game includes a gambling system and card drawing system that mimics real life Black Jack but currently only includes one versus one against the dealer. 
- The main focus of this project is practicing the basics of Javascript and so the visuals and animations are lacking


Pros:
- Betting system (when player's money reaches 0 the game resets)
- Matches Black Jack's rules

Improvements:
- Visuals (cards and animations)
- Dealer "AI" is very simple for when you challenge the dealer (Dealer has only two "if conditions" that decide its action)
- Adding an option to play against other bots besides the dealer who have differing strategies so there is a competitive aspect
- Clicking too fast can potential break the game (I need to learn how to implement delays and strategies to safeguard from this)
- Code can be more efficient and written more cleanly
